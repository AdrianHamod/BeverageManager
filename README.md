Description from https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/wade/projects/index.html
Propose an ontological model – possibly, by reusing (parts of) existing ontologies – regarding the most common non-alcoholic beverages. Also, create the knowledge graph including the (groups of) users' preferences about a certain set of beverages like coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drink, mocktail, plus their usages based on context – for example, a festive event, age, health restrictions (diabetes, lactose intolerance), location, season. Additionally, specify useful (meta-)data: category, price, ingredients, images, perishability, availability, offers, reviews, recipes, etc. Starting with this conceptual specification, a Web application will be developed in order to manage the collected knowledge and providing "smart" browsing and filtering, plus suggestions and correlations. Explore also BEVON: Beverage Ontology, FoodOn, Beverages @ Open Food Facts, and Product concept @ Schema.org.
